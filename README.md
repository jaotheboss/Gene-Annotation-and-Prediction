# Gene-Annotation-and-Prediction
This project is about predicting the location of a gene in the human genome based off experimental data. 

## Objective:
Predict the location of a gene in the human genome from a BAM file

## Context:
Gene annotation is incredibly difficult as there are multiple ways to detect the start and end of the gene within a chromosome.
However, for someone with no background in life sciences whatsoever, but is still keen on practicing data in this domain in some way, this simple project would suffice.
